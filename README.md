## Contributing
This repository uses [standard](http://standardjs.com/) as its coding style.

Install this module by cloning it and running `npm install`.
In addition to the usual things needed for the program to work, this will
also install a Git pre-commit hook that runs the linter before each commit
automatically. In the unlikely event that you need to overrule this, use
`git commit -n`.

A contributor might find the following useful:
