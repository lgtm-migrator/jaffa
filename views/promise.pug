        h1.heading-large Welcome
        p This is a really quickly written application and there's lots of security holes, so:
        form(method="POST")
          .form-group
            fieldset
              .multiple-choice
                input#promise(name="promise", type="checkbox", value="promise", required).form-control
                label(for="promise") I promise not to be a spoilsport
          .form-group
            input(type="submit", value="Begin ballot").button-get-started.button
        .panel
